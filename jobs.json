Through direct patient engagement, state of the art machine learning, and scientific expertise, PicnicHealth uniquely curates 100% of consenting patients’ medical records to generate the high quality and clinically-rich evidence that life sciences companies need, at a fraction of the cost of traditional study models. At the same time, we give patients immediate access to their medical records through a patient portal that simplifies participation and drives engagement.  To date we’ve helped tens of thousands of patients securely access their records and proactively contribute to advancing research in diseases that impact their lives. </p>\n<p>Founded in 2014, PicnicHealth partners with 12 of the top 20 biopharma companies and has raised over $100 million in venture capital from investors including Amplify Partners, Felicis Ventures and B Capital Group.</p>\n<p>If you are looking to join an <a href=\\"%22https://builtin.com/awards/san-francisco/2023/best-startup-places-to-work%22\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">award winning</a>, mission-driven, motivated team that is making a real impact across millions of people’s lives, PicnicHealth might just be the place for you.</p>\n<p><strong>The Opportunity</strong></p>\n<p>Machine learning is at the heart of our work and technical strategy.

This process enables us to build products that improve patient/doctor communication and care decisions, or develop the next generation of data-driven life-sciences studies. </p>\n<p>Our Machine Learning team’s goal is to capitalize on the latest technology to both expand our core capabilities and to improve the efficiency with which we process records in our existing pipeline. Our latest strategic initiatives have already begun putting large language models (LLMs) at the heart of our predictive techniques.

While school districts spend $28 billion annually on transportation, only 30% of kids get to school on a bus. The current system can no longer meet all the transportation needs of our districts, schools and families — and its shortcomings are causing inequities in educational access that are affecting the welfare of millions of kids each day.</p>\n<p>HopSkipDrive is taking a different approach to arranging safe, reliable school transportation that meets needs that aren’t being addressed by the current system, helping to fill gaps and supplement the student transportation options available. We create personalized transportation solutions for the one to the many, and everything in between. </p>\n<p><strong>We’re a company with heart</strong><strong><br></strong><strong><br></strong>Our partnerships with school districts, child welfare agencies and nonprofits ensure equitable educational access for the most vulnerable populations, including youth in foster care, children experiencing homelessness and students with disabilities. </p>\n<p>We understand that the difference between struggle and success can sometimes be as simple as the ability to show up, which is why we’re on a mission to use innovative technology — coupled with operational expertise and new ways of thinking — to help kids reach their full potential by providing a safe, dependable way to get them where they are going. </p>\n<p><strong>We’re an awesome place to work</strong><strong><br></strong><strong><br></strong>Our company culture has been well-recognized — HopSkipDrive has been named to Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies list, as well as Best Places to Work lists from Built In LA, Comparably, Inc., and the Los Angeles Business Journal.

The Senior Engineer requires very little oversight beyond high-level direction; they can take a complex user story, break it down into sub-tasks, and complete their sub-tasks with relative ease. The Senior Engineer shows initiative beyond knocking tasks off a list; they are able to identify and suggest areas of future work for themselves or their teams.

They contribute to the common code bases and standards for the team. They understand the business that their code supports, and possess empathy for the users of their software; they use this understanding to influence their task prioritization. They assist QA in identifying and validating test cases and can identify regression risks in their features. In general, they can identify risks in code, features, and design, and communicate these to the appropriate parties.</p>\n<p>The Senior Engineer is known outside of their core team as a technology leader.
